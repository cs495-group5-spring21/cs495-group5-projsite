At that                    rate, this group is projected to comprise 20 percent of the population while utilizing 50 percent of                    the nation’s health care resources.                This tremendous increase in the graying population of America has led to increased                    research in all areas of aging, and The University of Alabama has emerged as one of the nation’s                    leaders for applied research on aging.                                Our Mission                The mission of The Alabama Research Institute on Aging (ARIA) is to develop new                    knowledge, test new interventions, and disseminate information related to mental health and aging.                    Through applied interdisciplinary research, ARIA promotes improved quality of life for older adults.
